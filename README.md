This repository is for deterministic build results for Dash releases.

See the [release process](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/doc/release-process.md)
in the Dash repository for how to
deterministically build binaries and then pgp-sign them.

[Instructions for setting up a virtual machine](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md) in which you can
gitian build as well as [public keys of developers and active contributors](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/tree/master/contrib/gitian-keys) can also be found there.
